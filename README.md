Rigidbody
-------------
To ensure that the object (*i.e. player*) will not roll, you can *lock the rotation of the player* by selecting the ```x, y, z``` check-boxes for **Freeze Rotation** under the **Constraints** section in the object's *inspector*.


Asset Store
-------------
The [Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com) is where you can find:
-	Animations
-	Characters
-	Environments
-	Props
-	Audio

You can need to be logged in. When you use the "Add to My Assets" button to add any *asset* to your saved of assets. Then from Unity you can select the **Asset Store** tab and proceed to the "My Assets", where you can **Import** any of your assets into your project.
